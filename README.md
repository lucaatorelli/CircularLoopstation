# Introduction
CircularLoopstation is a web application develeloped for musician and composers that aims to assist them in the visualization of complex polyrithmic structures through the design of an innovative loopstation. The application comes with various controls and graphic features that give to the user a large number of possibilities in the construction of his own loop.

The application is developed by Gioele Greco and Luca Torelli, as part of the Advanced Coding Tools & Methodologies course at Politecnico di Milano, Italy.

CircularLoopstation is available at: https://circloopstation.surge.sh/

# Behind the concept

# The loopstation
CircularLoopstation allows the visualization of the rythmic structure thanks to a clock-like graphic component that follows the progression of the loop and shows the alternation of all the audio tracks that have been uploaded into the loop.

## Tracks management
The application provides two ways of importing an audio track inside the loop.
### Audio recording

### Uploading from database

## Graphics management
