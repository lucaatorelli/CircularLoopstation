# Introduction
CircularLoopstation is a web application develeloped for musician and composers that aims to assist them in the visualization of complex polyrithmic structures through the design of an innovative loopstation. The application comes with various controls and graphic features that give to the user a large number of possibilities in the construction of his own loop.

The application is developed by Gioele Greco and Luca Torelli, as part of the Advanced Coding Tools & Methodologies course at Politecnico di Milano, Italy.

# Behind the concept
Everyone says "music is made of rhythmic sound", so what is rhythm?

Rhythm in music is characterized by a repeating sequence of stressed (strong) and unstressed (weak) beats, and it's divided into bars organized by time signature and tempo indications.

Time signature is a notational convention used to specify how many beats are contained in each measure, and which note value is equivalent to a beat.
Tempo indication denotes how long is the beat distance. It's defined in beat per minutes and tipically it is associated to the ♩ (1/4). *(For example ♩=60bpm means that there is 1 ♩ every second)*

Time signature, normally, is based on fraction of 2 or 3. It's common to read on partitures quavers, triplets (3 notes played in the time of 2 equivalent notes), or multiple and submultiples of 2 and 3.

Since XX century, expecially in contempourary music and following in jazz and other genres, the composers decides to use more complex rhythms, like 13/16 or 7/13 and so on, played simultaneously. This to create an extraordinary exotic effect of cycles in cycles that can create changing harmonies with the same material. Today this technique is well known to mathphilus composers, who write their music without be anchored to the same metric subdivision.

This composing technique is called ***"polyrhythmic"*** and its meter is called polymeter.

# The loopstation
CircularLoopstation allows the visualization of the rythmic structure thanks to a clock-like graphic component that follows the progression of the loop and shows the alternation of all the audio tracks that have been uploaded into the loop. The loopstation is designed to be able to manage and visualize different signatures and durations at the same time, ensuring a simple but powerful understanding of the underlying structure of the cycle.

## Tracks management
The application provides two ways for importing an audio track into the loop.
### Audio recording
The first tool that have been developed for the creation of an audio track is a simple audio recorder.
